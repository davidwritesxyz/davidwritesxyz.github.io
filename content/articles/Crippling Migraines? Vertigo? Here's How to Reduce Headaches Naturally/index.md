Muscle tension can cause an insane amount of symptoms in the head and neck region:  

{{< icon "check" >}} Blurred Vision  
{{< icon "check" >}} Dizziness  
{{< icon "check" >}} Migraine Headaches  
{{< icon "check" >}} Nausea  
{{< icon "check" >}} Visual Disturbances  

Over-tense muscles can be caused by muscular imbalances, poor posture, or even suddenly-increased activity. Or, by things you put in your body like nicotine, alcohol, [caffeine](https://www.davidwrites.xyz/notes/caffeineblues/), certain medications, or sugar. 

To add to the list: emotional distress, nutritional deficiencies, coughing, allergic reactions, chemical withdrawal, and physical trauma. 

Muscle tension in the jaw, upper back, and neck muscles are the most common causes for the symptoms above. Pain in one area is often caused by a tight muscle in a different area. 

Upper back and shoulder tension causes neck pain, then your neck muscles cause headaches. 

Obviously, pain, headaches, and vertigo can have other causes besides tight muscles. But up to 80-90% of our physical pain is caused by Myofascial dysfunction. So it's worth starting here first. 

## The fix: self massage
Doing self massage is great because you can do it daily and for free. You can also use tools like [Therapy Balls](https://www.tuneupfitness.com/shop/massage-balls), lacrosse balls, or a Theracane to save your hands. 

Find a sore or tense muscle, then do 10 slow strokes per spot. Work bad areas multiple times per day. Aim for a 5/10 on the "Good pain" scale. 

If you suddenly find yourself holding your breath, then you are pressing too hard. Breath holding signals the brain that you are in trouble and can make your muscles tense up even more. 

Avoid anything that feels weird or gives you "bad pain". And as always, consult with your doctor before you do any of this. When in doubt, go see a professional.

[Jill Miller](https://www.youtube.com/@TuneUpFitness) has a lot of good videos on techniques you can use to massage different muscle groups. Each muscle listed below has the muscle highlighted in red. That is the area you are aiming to massage. 

## Tight muscles and their symptoms
### Scalenes

**Symptoms of tight scalene muscles**  
{{< icon "check" >}} Numbness  
{{< icon "check" >}} Tingling  
{{< icon "check" >}} Weird sensations in chest, shoulder, arm, neck, and hand  

Tight scalenes can pull the first rib up into the collar bone and squeeze blood vessels  and nerves. Restricted bloodflow and nerve disturbance can cause pain, burning, numbness, and tingling all the way down the arm and hands (thoracic outlet syndrome).

It's worth starting here because scalenes can cause so many other muscles to also be tense.

**Common causes for tight scalene muscles**  
{{< icon "check" >}} Poor breathing mechanics (breathing too much with accessory breathing muscles instead of diaphragm)  
{{< icon "check" >}} Hyperventilating   
{{< icon "check" >}} Heavy coughing or sneezing  
{{< icon "check" >}} Emotional tension  
{{< icon "check" >}} Working long hours with hands out in front of you 
{{< icon "check" >}} Stress from caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine use

**What you should do**
Work on your [posture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQhqv_0d-nw), such as keeping your head center, not slouching, etc. And practice diaphragm breathing with [deadbugs](https://nick-e.com/deadbug/). Meditation, therapy, or journaling may help with emotional distress. Quit using caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, etc. 

Massage the muscles in the front and side of the neck, being careful to avoid pulses and anything that feels weird. Do this throughout the day to relax these muscles. 

### Sternocleidomastoid

**Symptoms of tight sternocleidomastoid muscles**  
{{< icon "check" >}} Vertigo  
{{< icon "check" >}} Blurred vision  
{{< icon "check" >}} Dizziness  
{{< icon "check" >}} Migraines  
{{< icon "check" >}} Nausea  
{{< icon "check" >}} Visual disturbances  

Tension here can cause dizziness that can occur suddenly or last for minutes, hours, or days. And often given a diagnosis of vertigo.

Sternocleidomastoid muscles help with spatial orientation that helps your brain keep track of the position of your head. Confusing signals are sent to the brain when there is tension here. 

This can also cause a referred spasm in the muscle that surrounds the eye. Leading to blurry vision.

**Common causes for tight sternocleidomastoid muscles**  
{{< icon "check" >}} Bad head posture  
{{< icon "check" >}} Other trigger points or muscle imbalance  
{{< icon "check" >}} Whiplash  
{{< icon "check" >}} Using breath accessory muscles instead of diaphragm.  

**What you should do**
Pinch and rub the big muscle you feel on the front of your neck when you turn your head. And work on your breathing and posture. 
### Trapezius
