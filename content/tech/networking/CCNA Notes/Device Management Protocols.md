the example configures the same message level at the console and for terminal monitoring  
(level 7, or debug), and the same level for both buffered and logging to the syslog server (level 4, or warning). The levels may be set using the numeric severity level or the name as  
shown earlier in Figure 9-3.  
**show logging** messages per the logging buffered configuration.commandconfirms those same configuration settings and also lists the log

If any log messages had been buffered, the actual log messages would be listed at  
the end of the command

```

#### Network Time Protocol (NTP)

```
Devices send timestamps to each other with NTP messages, continually exchanging messages, with one device changing its clock to match the other, eventually synchronizing the clocks.
How NTP defines the sources of time data (stratum). (reference clocks) andhow good each time source is
```

**Setting the Time and Timezone**  
NTP works best if you set the device clock to a reasonably close time before enabling the NTP  
client functionwith the **ntp server** command  
I shouldset the time to 8:52 p.m., set the correct date and timezone, and even tell the device to  
adjust for daylight savings time—and then enable NTP  
Example 9-7 shows how to set the date, time, timezone, and daylight savings time.

```
You should set the first two commands before setting the time of day with the EXEC command because the two configuration commands impact the time that is set. clock set
chose EDT because it is the acronym for daylight savings time in that same EST time zone.
Finally, thehour automatically over the years.recurring keyword tells the router to spring forward an hour and fall back an
clock set EXEC command
uses a time syntax with a 24-hour format, not with a 12-hour format plus a.m./p.m.).

```
uses a time syntax with a 24-hour format, not with a 12-hour format plus a.m./p.m.).
The EDT, rather than UTC time. show clock command (issued seconds later)lists that time, but also notes the time as
```

**Basic NTP Configuration**  
two ntp configuration commands  
**ntp master {stratum** not as an NTP client. The device gets its time information from the internal clock on the **- level}:** NTP server mode—the device acts only as an NTP server, and  
device.  
**ntp server {address | hostname}** : NTP client/server mode—the device acts as both client  
and serversynchronized, the device can then act as an NTP server, to supply time to other NTP. First, it acts as an NTP client, to synchronize time with a server. Once  
clients.

```
show ntp status command
```

**show ntp status** command  
lists a status of synchronizedchanging its time to match the server’s time. , which confirms the NTP client has completed the process of Any router acting as an NTP client will list  
“unsynchronized” in that first line until the NTP synchronization process completes with at least one server. It also confirms the IP address of the server—this device’s reference  
clock—with the IP address configured in Example 9-8 (172.16.2.2).

```
show ntp associations
lists all the NTP servers that the local device can attempt to use, with status information
about the association between the local device (client) and the various NTP servers.
```

###### NTP Reference Clock and Stratum

```
Devices that act solely as an NTP server get their time from either internal device hardware or from some external clock using mechanisms other than NTP.
NTP servers and clients use a number to show the perceived accuracy of their reference clock data based on stratum level. The lower the stratum level, the more accurate the reference clock
is considered to be.sets its own stratum level. Then,An NTP server that uses its internal hardware or external reference clock an NTP client adds 1 to the stratum level it learns from its NTP
server, so that the stratum level increases the more hops away from the original clock source.
For instance, back in Figure 9which references R3, adds 1 so it has a stratum of 3. R1 uses R2 as its NTP server, so R1 adds 1 to -5, you can see the NTP primary server (R3) with a stratum of 2. R2,
have a stratum of 4. These increasing stratum levels allow devices to refer to several NTP servers
and then use time information from the best NTP server, best being the server with the lowest stratum level.
Routers and switches use the default stratum level of 8 for their internal reference clock based
on the default setting of 8 for the stratum level in the command allows you to set a value from 1 through 15 ntp master [stratum ; in Example 9-8, the - ntp master 2level] command. The
command set router R3’s stratum level to 2.
Note
NTP considers 15 to be the highest useful stratum level, so any devices that calculate their
stratum as 16 consider the time data unusable and do not trust the time. So, avoid setting higher stratum values on the ntp master command.
```

```
stratum values on the ntp master command.
```

###### Redundant NTP Configuration

```
an enterprise could use NTP to reference NTP servers that use an atomic clock as their reference source, like the NTP primary servers in Figure 9-6, which happen to be run by the US National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (see tf.nist.gov).
```

```
AnNTP primary server acts only as a server, with a reference clock external to the device,
and has a stratum level of 1secondary servers are servers that use client/server mode as described throughout this , like the two NTP primary servers shown in Figure 9-6.NTP
section, relying on synchronization with some other NTP server.
```

```
NTP primary server and NTP secondary server.
```

```
After losing their reference clock, R1 and R2 could no longer be useful NTP servers to the rest of the enterprise.
To overcome this potential issue, the routers can also be configured with the ntp master
command, resulting in this logic:
Establish an association with the NTP servers per thentp server command.
Establish an association with your internal clock using the ntp master stratum command.
Set the stratum level of the internal clock (per thea higher (worse) stratum level than the Internet-based NTP servers.ntp master {stratum-level} command) to
Synchronize with the best (lowest) known time source, which will be one of the Internet NTP servers in this scenario
ntp master 7 command, with a much higher stratum,
```

###### NTP Using a Loopback Interface for Better Availability

```
what happens when one interface on R4 fails
for any NTP clients that had referred to that specific IP address
There would likely still be a route to reach R4 itself.
The NTP client would not be able to send packets to the configured address because that interface is down.
```

```
loopback interface to meet that exact need
once configured, it remains in an up/up state as long as
Key Topic.The router remains up.
You do not issue a shutdown command on that loopback interface.
```

#### Analyzing Topology Using CDP and LLDP

###### Examining Information Learned by CDP

```
Cisco-proprietary
Layer 2 protocol
does not rely on a working Layer 3 protocol
```

does not rely on a working Layer 3 protocol  
Devices that support CDP learn information about others by listening for the advertisements sent by other devices.

CDP discovers several useful details from the neighboring Cisco devices:

**Device identifier** : Typically the host name  
**Address list:** Network and data-link addresses  
**Port identifier:** link that sent the CDP advertisementThe interface on the remote router or switch on the other end of the  
**Capabilities list** : Information on what type of device it is (for example, a router or a  
switch)  
**Platform** : The model and OS level running on the device  
Cisco IP Phones use CDP to learn the data and voice VLAN IDs as configured on the access  
switch.

routers and switches support the same CDP commands, with the same parameters and  
same types of output.

To ensure all devices receive a CDP message, tdestination MAC address (0100.0CCC.CCCC). he Ethernet header uses a multicast

the device processes the message and then discards it, rather than forwarding it  
**show cdp neighbors detail**  
lists the full name of the switch model (WSconfigured on the neighboring device. -2960XR-24TS-I) and the IP address

```
The show cdp entry name command lists the exact same details shown in the output of
the command. show cdp neighbors detail command, but for only the one neighbor listed in the
Cisco recommends that CDP be disabled on any interface that might not have a need for CDP. For switches, any switch port connected to another switch, a router, or to an IP
phone should use CDP.
```

###### Configuring and Verifying CDP

```
IOS typically enables CDP globally and on each interface by defaultinterface with the no cdp enable interface subcommand. You can then disable CDP per
re-enable it with the cdp enable interface subcommand
disable and re-enable CDP globally on the device
no cdp run and cdp run global commands

```
send time and the hold time. CDP sends messages every 60 seconds by default, with a hold time
of 180 seconds.device before removing those details from the CDP tables. You can override the defaults with The hold time tells the device how long to wait after no longer hearing from a
the cdp timer seconds and cdp holdtime seconds global commands, respectively.
```

#### Examining Information Learned by LLDP

the LLDP output in the example does differ from CDP in a few important ways:

```
LLDP uses B as the capability code for switching, referring to bridgetype that existed before switches that performed the same basic functions., a term for the device
LLDP does not identify IGMP as a capability, while CDP does (I).
CDP lists the neighbor’s platform, a code that defines the device type, while LLDP does not.
LLDP lists capabilities with different conventions (see upcoming Example 9-19).
```

```
System Capabilities : What the device can do
Enabled Capabilities : What the device does now with its current configuration
LLDP uses the same messaging concepts as CDP, encapsulating messages directly in dataheaders. Devices do not forward LLDP messages so that LLDP learns only of directly connected -link
neighbors. LLDP does use a differentmulticast MAC address(0180.C200.000E)
```

```
Cisco devices default to disable LLDP
LLDP separates the sending and receiving of LLDP messages as separate functions.
LLDP support processing receives LLDP messages on an interface so that the switch or router
learns about the neighboring device while not transmitting LLDP messages to the neighboring device.
the commands include options to toggle on|off the transmission of LLDP messages separately
from the processing of received messages.
[no] lldp run: A global configuration command thatsets the default mode of LLDP operationfor
any interface that does not have more specific LLDP subcommands (lldp transmit, lldp receive). The lldp run global command enables LLDP in both directions on those interfaces, while no lldp
```

###### Configuring and Verifying LLDP

The lldp run global command enables LLDP in both directions on those interfaces, while no lldp run disables LLDP.

**[no] lldp transmit** : An interface sub-command that defines the operation of LLDP on the  
interface subcommand causes the device to transmit LLDP messages, while no lldp transmit causes it to regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp transmit interface  
not transmit LLDP messages.  
**[no] lldp receive** :An interface subcommand that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface  
regardless of the global [no] lldp run command.the device to process received LLDP messages, while no lldp receive causes it to not process The lldp receive interface subcommand causes  
received LLDP messages.

**show lldp interface** lists the interfaces on which LLDP is enabled.

like CDP,shows the default settings of 30 seconds for the send timer and 120 seconds for the hold timer. LLDP uses a send timer and hold timer for the same purposes as CDP.The example  
You can override the defaults with the commands **lldp timer seconds** and **lldp holdtime seconds** global

## QoS: Managing Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter, and Loss

```
four characteristics of network traffic:
Bandwidth
refers to the speed of a link, in bits per second (bps)
helps to also think of bandwidth as the capacity of the link, in terms of how many bits can be sent over the link per second.
Delay
the time between sending one packet and that same packet arriving at the destination host
Round-trip delay
Jitter the time it takes to send one packet between two hosts and receive one back
variation in one-way delay between consecutive packets sent by the same application
Loss
the number of lost messages, usually as a percentage of packets sent.
people think of loss as something caused by faulty cabling or poor WAN services. That is one cause. However, more loss happens because of the normal operation of the
networking devices, in which the devices’ queues get too full, so the device has nowhere to put new packets, and it discards the packet.
